C# Animal simulator.
Practical object oriented programming.
In the program, we examine herbivores and carnivores in two types of animals.
We can specify the number of herbivores and their life cycle.
In the case of predators, the hunger number is how long they can last without food and we can enter their number.
Each animal species reproduces, it depends if they are located next to each other.
